This is a simple beginner project I created in the Prague Coding School course on Python essentials.
It contains an employee database and provides means to view, list, sort, print, add, edit, delete, export and import.

1) The project is set up within a virtual environment.
2) This project is backed up at a Github repository.
3) The code is documented with # notes.
4) The project uses libraries like pandas. 
5) It defines several functions.
6) There is a "try-except" to handle errors.
7) There are while loop and conditional statements.
8) The code makes effort to handle typing errors made by users.
9) Any changes are remembered by the programme and can be stored for later use
